## About

This project aims to develop an application to streamline the management of student admissions at the Faculdade de Educação Técnologica do Estado do Rio de Janeiro Fernando Motta institution. The app processes data provided by the Ministry of Education’s Sistema de Seleção Unificada system and provides the means to manage applicants, calls and reports.

The current code is somewhat messy and hastily assembled due to the tight deadline for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It bears a resemblance to the [eXtreme Go Horse Methodology](https://medium.com/@dekaah/22-axioms-of-the-extreme-go-horse-methodology-xgh-9fa739ab55b4).
In the upcoming months, there will be a major rewrite of the application while retaining all the existing functionality.
